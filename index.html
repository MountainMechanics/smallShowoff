            Banksy is a streetartist.
            A lot of people in the industry don´t like his work because its too "on the nose", the points he´s making are too obvious.<br><br>
            <span class="highlight">Using stencils</span> and graffiti spray-cans Banksy quickly creates his work <span class="highlight">without being seen</span>.<br>
            Even tho his pieces do reach a high amount in auctions during biddings, he <span class="highlight">doesn´t like art being created only for monetary reasons</span>.

            His art is greatly adored and received a lot of attention in the media during the auction of his piece <span class="highlight">"Balloon Girl"</span>.<br>
            The artwork was <span class="highlight">shredded using blades hidden within the frame of the picture</span>. Everybody at the auction was horrified.

            <span class="font-header">Story</span><br><br>
            In London he had a confrontation with <span class="highlight">Robbo, a well-known Graffiti artist</span> of the city. Banksy integrated the oldest and most popular piece of all of London into one of his own works and <span class="highlight">broke a rule of graffiti</span>.<br>
            In graffiti that is a <span class="highlight">big NOGO</span> because you effectively steal someone else´s piece to make your own better.<br>
            This led to <span class="highlight">"war" between Robbo and Banksy</span>.

                “The thing I hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright, creative and ambitious young people, leaving us mainly with the slow and self-obsessed to become our artists.<br>
                Modern art is a disaster area.<br>
                Never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little.”<br>
